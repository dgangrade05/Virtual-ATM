# Virtual-ATM
This is a simple implementation of an ATM Machine and it's functioning. It is an overview of how and what an ATM machine does. Made with core java and JDBC connectivity , this project can keep a track of records as well.
Here are the functions this project performs :
1. Sign in to your account.
2. Create an account if you don't have one.
3. Collects and stores Sign up information in the database.
4. Deposit Money
5. Withdraw Money
6. Balance Enquiry
7. Change credentials
8. Generates after transaction mini statement
9. Keeps a record of all the transactions in the database.


While it does not give real money , although we would've loved it if it did so , it is an Virtual ATM Machine implementation.
